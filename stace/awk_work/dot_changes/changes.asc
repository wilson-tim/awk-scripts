This documents all the changes to each program since the BETA release of
Pharaoh JSB v1.4.1 (16th May 2000), and replaces the CRN number system.
The DATE is the date that the change was PUT, ie. made final.
The FORM/SCRIPT/REPORT/SPEC/LIB section includes the new version of the
FORM/SCRIPT/REPORT/SPEC/LIB which was created when the
FORM/SCRIPT/REPORT/SPEC/LIB was PUT.
Any new releases are documented as a separate entry along with the date they
were released and a brief comment about what the release is for. As this
document is in date order, all changes involved in the new release are
documented ABOVE the release entry.

---------------------- ------------------------------ -------------------------
22nd May 2000         - ph_hist.fq (form) 1.10       - William Wragg
The screen form has been changed to speed up finding of records. The 'group by' clause was dropped from the form. The grouping was by the 'financial_year' and 'period' fields.

22nd May 2000         - ca_dets.fs (script) 1.27     - William Wragg
When there were no charges run dates the program was still allowing records to be added, additionally these records could have their replacement_date field edited directly, without using the amend asset form. This has now been fixed. 'next action is clear_to_find' added so that a record cann't be added if the Required Financial Period records are missing. This change replaces the 'break' statement that was supposed to do this.

24th May 2000         - jsb_functions.h (lib) 1.1    - William Wragg
A new library was created for Pharaoh JSB. This library contains all the functions required for the JSB buttons that were added to some of the zoom forms.

If the order_line is flagged as complete in the GRN screen - oh_dets.line_status = 'Y' - and their is only ONE oustanding GRN to be invoiced, then the complete flag on this screen - the final invoice screen - defaults to 'Y', and does not allow the user to change it.

22nd June 2000        - purch_req.fs (script) 1.4    - William Wragg

29th June 2000        - year_end.fs (script) 1.10    - William Wragg
The PROJECTS section was calculating the pj_dets.paid_prev_years slowly and incorrectly. It has now been ammended so that it only works out the expenditure for the current year and adds it to the previous value held in pj_dets.paid_prev_years. Only fx_dets and ph_hist are queried. fx_dets for invoices, credit notes, financial adjustments and journals. ph_hist for labour and materials. ol_dets is now only gone through to update the orderlines prev_years_exp.

29th June 2000        - per_yr_end.fq (form) 1.2     - William Wragg

This is for version 1.5 of padckt_fb4. There is no info in the development history for version 1.5, but the info is as below. Ammended the 'after form return' section so that it checks to see if when returning from cw_job the user has still left mandatory fields unfilled & if this is the case throws the user back to pa_fb1. If they have filled in the mandatory fields then the form no longer throws the user back to pa_fb1 but leaves them to fill in the rest of padckt_fb4.

06th July 2000        - cw_job.fs (script) 1.24      - William Wragg
If coming from Docket Feedback standard/performance, the mandatory fields can now be tabbed between. Also fixed the contract_code vanishing problem, so that the contract_code once entered does not disappear until dorc_flag changed to 'D' - from 'C'. Removed from the 'on previous form' section the reference to the previous form being pa_fb1, as this form never calls cw_job.

TaskID:2434  If only 'D' type PM jobs were selected then the user was not being allowed to select the workshop code. This has now been changed, so that the workshop code is allways selectable. The contract type is still skipped on 'D' type PM jobs. If the user selects 'N' in the 'Finished selection Y/N' field the user was being kicked out of the form, as if they had already run the report. The user can now go back to the top of the screen and re-enter data if they select 'N'.

19th December 2000    - pmyear.fs (script) 1.8       - William Wragg
Ammended the future year next scheduled week section, so that it correctly calculates the future year start date for a PM job, in BOTH low weeks mode and standard weeks mode. The 53rd week is ignored, except for the actual requsted year, as each year in the future year calculations is assumed to be 52 weeks. Fixed some other bugs in the schedule_jobs() macro so that the jobs do not get automatically scheduled, regardless of lower frequency jobs and 52/53 weeks years, when it is the first occurence of the job in the year. See Tasks 2379 and 2438.

17th January 2001     - cw_job.fs (script) 1.25      - William Wragg
Task 2265: Fixed bug whereby the standard job details overwrote the job_details; If a new job is created, and a standard job description is selected from the trade field, and the new job is saved, and then the user goes into the job_details field and goes into it to amend the job_details and then saves it, everything is ok, even if they then go on and create another new job, or exit the cw_job screen. But if the user after just ammending and saving the job_details,  makes a change in the main job screen (because they perhaps entered the wrong data) and then resaves it, the job_details field gets overwritten with the original standard job desrciption. A bug whereby if a job was being updated with a new standard job description, and then saved, after the original job description was deleted, the form would not update the job details field and leave it showing 'NO TEXT' even when a user had just saved some.

TASK 1878 The stock_number was updating the cost field. This meant that the current_record was always modified, therefore the is_current_record_stored$() was always false. The cost field is now only updated when the record changes, thereby stopping the annoying warning when moving between records.

TASK 2342 The wk_done records which were being locked by this zoom form were not being unlocked when the user left the form. This has now been fixed.

8th February 2001     - tr_to_hist.fs (script) 1.14  - William Wragg
If there are multiple hrs_wrkd records with no docket number - all the same except for the uniquifier column - then when one of them gets transferred to history (cc_phist) and gets deleted from the hrs_wrkd table, it deletes all the other records with the same details. Therefore when the next record in the set of records with the same details gets transferred to history, it cannot delete itself from the hrs_wrkd table, as the previous record has already done this. The solution is to use the hrs_wrkd.uniquifier column to delete blank docketed records when they are transfered across to cc_phist. TASK 2348

If the attached_to_job flag is set to 'Y' then the user should not be allowed to enter a charge code, and any charge code that exists should be removed. This now happens correctly. The 'activity' table will have to be purged of account_codes and cost_centres for records with the attached_to_job flag set to 'Y'. TASK 2461

9th February 2001     - stk_rtiss.fs (script) 1.2    - William Wragg
The ph_hist materials_costs were not being updated when stock was returned from a completed job. This meant that the materials costs against an asset in history were incorrect. This has now been corrected. TASK 2259
