22th May 2000         - ph_hist.fq (form) 1.10       - William Wragg
The screen form has been changed to speed up finding of records. The 'group by' clause was dropped from the form. The grouping was by the 'financial_year' and 'period' fields.

22th May 2000         - ca_dets.fs (script) 1.27     - William Wragg
When there were no charges run dates the program was still allowing records to be added, additionally these records could have their replacement_date field edited directly, without using the amend asset form. This has now been fixed. 'next action is clear_to_find' added so that a record cann't be added if the Required Financial Period records are missing. This change replaces the 'break' statement that was supposed to do this.

24th May 2000         - jsb_functions.h (lib) 1.1    - William Wragg
A new library was created for Pharaoh JSB. This library contains all the functions required for the JSB buttons that were added to some of the zoom forms.

If the order_line is flagged as complete in the GRN screen - oh_dets.line_status = 'Y' - and their is only ONE oustanding GRN to be invoiced, then the complete flag on this screen - the final invoice screen - defaults to 'Y', and does not allow the user to change it.

22nd June 2000        - purch_req.fs (script) 1.4    - William Wragg

29th June 2000        - year_end.fs (script) 1.10    - William Wragg
The PROJECTS section was calculating the pj_dets.paid_prev_years slowly and incorrectly. It has now been ammended so that it only works out the expenditure for the current year and adds it to the previous value held in pj_dets.paid_prev_years. Only fx_dets and ph_hist are queried. fx_dets for invoices, credit notes, financial adjustments and journals. ph_hist for labour and materials. ol_dets is now only gone through to update the orderlines prev_years_exp.

29th June 2000        - per_yr_end.fq (form) 1.2     - William Wragg

This is for version 1.5 of padckt_fb4. There is no info in the development history for version 1.5, but the info is as below. Ammended the 'after form return' section so that it checks to see if when returning from cw_job the user has still left mandatory fields unfilled & if this is the case throws the user back to pa_fb1. If they have filled in the mandatory fields then the form no longer throws the user back to pa_fb1 but leaves them to fill in the rest of padckt_fb4.

06th July 2000        - cw_job.fs (script) 1.24      - William Wragg
If coming from Docket Feedback standard/performance, the mandatory fields can now be tabbed between. Also fixed the contract_code vanishing problem, so that the contract_code once entered does not disappear until dorc_flag changed to 'D' - from 'C'. Removed from the 'on previous form' section the reference to the previous form being pa_fb1, as this form never calls cw_job.
