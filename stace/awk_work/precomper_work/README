These are the programs required for precompilation on SCO:
prepre
precomper
postpre

NOTE:
'precomper' runs 'prepre' then the usual 'precomper' sections and then runs 
'postpre'. To run 'precomper' the ACPLPP shell variable must be set to point to
where 'precomper' resides, eg. $PHABASE/bin/precomper
'prepre' might need to be run on the lib files. This is because they are not
touched by 'precomper' but are handled directly by the system precompilation
program. The only lib files that seem to need this though are 'wims.h' and
'pharaoh.h'. The original files that have not been run through 'prepre'
first are held in 'wims.h.no_prepre' and 'pharaoh.h.no_prepre' respectively.
