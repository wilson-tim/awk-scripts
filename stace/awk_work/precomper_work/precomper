# These are the programs required for precompilation on SCO:
# prepre
# precomper
# postpre

# NOTE:
# 'precomper' runs 'prepre' then the usual 'precomper' sections and then runs
# 'postpre'. To run 'precomper' the ACPLPP shell variable must be set to point
# to where 'precomper' resides, eg. $PHABASE/bin/precomper
# 'prepre' might need to be run on the lib files. This is because they are not
# touched by 'precomper' but are handled directly by the system precompilation
# program. The only lib files that seem to need this though are 'wims.h' and
# 'pharaoh.h'. The original files that have not been run through 'prepre'
# first are held in 'wims.h.no_prepre' and 'pharaoh.h.no_prepre' respectively.
